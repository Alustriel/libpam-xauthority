This is the README for pam_xauthority, a PAM SESSION module which sets
$XAUTHORITY to a securely created file in /tmp in pam_open_session,
and unlinks the file in pam_close_session.  This is useful if you are
in an environment where home directories are on network filesystems
and don't want to share your xauthority files.  

One uses the module by adding the line

session    optional   pam_xauthority.so 

in /etc/pam.d/ssh.

It supports two options: debug (for debugging output) and an option
dir=/var/tmp changing the directory that it places xauthority files
into.  So, the pam-xauthority session line might look like:

session    optional   pam_xauthority.so debug dir=/var/tmp
